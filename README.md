# pickup-finder

Proposal
--

1. Project name: Pickup Sport Finder
2. Members: Matt Garnett, Rick Huang, Georgie Mathews 
3. Motivation: We want to be able to quickly and easily setup pickup games with people who are a similar skill level. Oftentimes it can be frustrating to find a possible pickup game around college campuses across the United States due to the lack of knowledge of the potential players and games occurring at different courts and fields around you. This app seeks to alleviate this issue by providing a real time map that shows potential pickup games near your location to prevent the possibility of going to different fields and not being able to find a game. 
4. Request new players and request for a game using geolocation in real time. 
5. Geolocation, cellular network, wifi
6. React native mobile app with Firebase backend
7. Timeline: 
  - Week 5: Research potential frameworks and modules to implement for better functionality and ease of use 
  - Week 6: Begin implementation and writing of code to perform desired functionality
  - Week 7: Pushing data to Firebase database using both a wireless network and geolocation
  - Week 8: Pulling data from database to show geolocation for games near area 
  - Week 9: Testing of application 
  - Week 10: Presentation
